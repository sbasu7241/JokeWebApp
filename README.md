# Joke Webapp

My first web application built using Django that uses a Joke API to fetch random jokes corresponding to name entered by the user.It also uses SQLite3 to manage a database of users who would like to contact the owner of the webpage.

### Running the web app locally

Run these commands to set up the app:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sbasu7241/JokeWebApp
```
